# Element

Element (formerly known as Vector and Riot) is a Matrix web client built using the [Matrix
JS SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk).

# Supported Environments

Element has several tiers of support for different environments:

- Supported
    - Definition:
        - Issues **actively triaged**, regressions **block** the release
    - Last 2 major versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on desktop OSes
    - Last 2 versions of Safari
    - Latest release of official Element Desktop app on desktop OSes
    - Desktop OSes means macOS, Windows, and Linux versions for desktop devices
      that are actively supported by the OS vendor and receive security updates
- Best effort
    - Definition:
        - Issues **accepted**, regressions **do not block** the release
        - The wider Element Products(including Element Call and the Enterprise Server Suite) do still not officially support these browsers.
        - The element web project and its contributors should keep the client functioning and gracefully degrade where other sibling features (E.g. Element Call) may not function.
    - Last major release of Firefox ESR and Chrome/Edge Extended Stable
- Community Supported
    - Definition:
        - Issues **accepted**, regressions **do not block** the release
        - Community contributions are welcome to support these issues
    - Mobile web for current stable version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on Android, iOS, and iPadOS
- Not supported
    - Definition: Issues only affecting unsupported environments are **closed**
    - Everything else

The period of support for these tiers should last until the releases specified above, plus 1 app release cycle(2 weeks). In the case of Firefox ESR this is extended further to allow it land in Debian Stable.

For accessing Element on an Android or iOS device, we currently recommend the
native apps [element-android](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android)
and [element-ios](https://github.com/element-hq/element-ios).

# Getting Started

The easiest way to test Element is to just use the hosted copy at <https://app.element.io>.
The `develop` branch is continuously deployed to <https://develop.element.io>
for those who like living dangerously.

To host your own instance of Element see [Installing Element Web](docs/install.md).

To install Element as a desktop application, see [Running as a desktop app](#running-as-a-desktop-app) below.

# Important Security Notes

## Separate domains

We do not recommend running Element from the same domain name as your Matrix
homeserver. The reason is the risk of XSS (cross-site-scripting)
vulnerabilities that could occur if someone caused Element to load and render
malicious user generated content from a Matrix API which then had trusted
access to Element (or other apps) due to sharing the same domain.

We have put some coarse mitigations into place to try to protect against this
situation, but it's still not good practice to do it in the first place. See
<https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/issues/1977> for more details.

## Configuration best practices

Unless you have special requirements, you will want to add the following to
your web server configuration when hosting Element Web:

- The `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` header, to prevent Element Web from being
  framed and protect from [clickjacking][owasp-clickjacking].
- The `frame-ancestors 'self'` directive to your `Content-Security-Policy`
  header, as the modern replacement for `X-Frame-Options` (though both should be
  included since not all browsers support it yet, see
  [this][owasp-clickjacking-csp]).
- The `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header, to [disable MIME
  sniffing][mime-sniffing].
- The `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block;` header, for basic XSS protection in
  legacy browsers.

[mime-sniffing]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#mime_sniffing
[owasp-clickjacking-csp]: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet.html#content-security-policy-frame-ancestors-examples
[owasp-clickjacking]: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet.html

If you are using nginx, this would look something like the following:

```
add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
add_header Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors 'self'";
```

For Apache, the configuration looks like:

```
Header set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN
Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header set Content-Security-Policy "frame-ancestors 'self'"
```

Note: In case you are already setting a `Content-Security-Policy` header
elsewhere, you should modify it to include the `frame-ancestors` directive
instead of adding that last line.

# Building From Source

Element is a modular webapp built with modern ES6 and uses a Node.js build system.
Ensure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed.

Using `yarn` instead of `npm` is recommended. Please see the Yarn [install
guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if you do not have it already.

1. Install or update `node.js` so that your `node` is at least the current recommended LTS.
1. Install `yarn` if not present already.
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/element-hq/element-web.git`.
1. Switch to the element-web directory: `cd element-web`.
1. Install the prerequisites: `yarn install`.
    - If you're using the `develop` branch, then it is recommended to set up a
      proper development environment (see [Setting up a dev
      environment](#setting-up-a-dev-environment) below). Alternatively, you
      can use <https://develop.element.io> - the continuous integration release of
      the develop branch.
1. Configure the app by copying `config.sample.json` to `config.json` and
   modifying it. See the [configuration docs](docs/config.md) for details.
1. `yarn dist` to build a tarball to deploy. Untaring this file will give
   a version-specific directory containing all the files that need to go on your
   web server.

Note that `yarn dist` is not supported on Windows, so Windows users can run `yarn build`,
which will build all the necessary files into the `webapp` directory. The version of Element
will not appear in Settings without using the dist script. You can then mount the
`webapp` directory on your web server to actually serve up the app, which is
entirely static content.

# Running as a Desktop app

Element can also be run as a desktop app, wrapped in Electron. You can download a
pre-built version from <https://element.io/get-started> or, if you prefer,
build it yourself.

To build it yourself, follow the instructions at <https://github.com/element-hq/element-desktop>.

Many thanks to @aviraldg for the initial work on the Electron integration.

The [configuration docs](docs/config.md#desktop-app-configuration) show how to override the desktop app's default settings if desired.

# config.json

Element supports a variety of settings to configure default servers, behaviour, themes, etc.
See the [configuration docs](docs/config.md) for more details.

# Labs Features

Some features of Element may be enabled by flags in the `Labs` section of the settings.
Some of these features are described in [labs.md](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/blob/develop/docs/labs.md).

# Caching requirements

Element requires the following URLs not to be cached, when/if you are serving Element from your own webserver:

```
/config.*.json
/i18n
/home
/sites
/index.html
```

We also recommend that you force browsers to re-validate any cached copy of Element on page load by configuring your
webserver to return `Cache-Control: no-cache` for `/`. This ensures the browser will fetch a new version of Element on
the next page load after it's been deployed. Note that this is already configured for you in the nginx config of our
Dockerfile.

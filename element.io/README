This directory contains the config files and deployment scripts for the official
element.io distribution of Element Web.

You probably do not want to build with this config unless you're building the
official element.io distribution, but these files may be useful if you want to
inspect the configuration used there.

Element Desktop uses a separate config (see
https://github.com/element-hq/element-desktop/tree/develop/element.io).

Deployment scripts (such as app/deploy.py) are meant to be run on the web server
hosting the Element installation.

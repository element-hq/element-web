# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Create Release

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request 
# events but only for the master branch
on:
    push:
      # Sequence of patterns matched against refs/tags
      tags:
        - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10
  
# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
    - name: Build
      run: |
        yarn install
        yarn dist
    - name: Create Zip # This would actually build your project, using zip for an example artifact

    # make sure we work with a range of node versions.
    # As of the time of writing:
    #  - 4.x is still in LTS (until April 2018), but some of our deps (notably
    #    extract-zip) don't work with it
    #  - 5.x has been EOLed for nearly a year.
    #  - 6.x is the current 'LTS' version
    #  - 7.x is the current 'current' version (until October 2017)
    #
    # see: https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/
    #
    # anything before 6.3 ships with npm 3.9 or earlier, which had problems
    # with symlinks in node_modules (see
    # https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.10.0 'FIXES AND REFACTORING').
    - 6.3
    - 6

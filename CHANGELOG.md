 * SECURITY UPDATE: Fix the force TURN option for inbound calls. This option forced the use
   of TURN but only worked for outbound calls and not inbound calls. This means that if you
   enabled this option expecting it to mask your IP address in calls, your IP would still
   have been revealed to the room if you accepted an incoming call.
 * Also adds the Slovak translation.

/* SCSS variables representing a range of standard lengths.
 *
 * Avoid using these in new code: we cannot adjust their values without causing massive confusion, so they are
 * effectively equivalent to using hardcoded values.
 *
 * In future, we plan to introduce variables named according to their purpose rather than their size. Additionally,
 * we want switch to custom CSS properties (https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/21656), so we might have
 * `--spacing-standard` or something. For now, you might as well use hardcoded px values for lengths (except for font
 * sizes, for which see the `$font-<N>px` variables).

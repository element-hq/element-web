/**
 * Represents a minimal store which works similar to Flux stores. Instead
 * of everything needing to happen in a dispatch cycle, everything can
 * happen async to that cycle.
 *
 * The store operates by using Object.assign() to mutate state - it sends the
 * state objects (current and new) through the function onto a new empty
 * object. Because of this, it is recommended to break out your state to be as
 * safe as possible. The state mutations are also locked, preventing concurrent
 * writes.
 *
 * All updates to the store happen on the UPDATE_EVENT event channel with the
 * one argument being the instance of the store.
 *
 * To update the state, use updateState() and preferably await the result to
 * help prevent lock conflicts.

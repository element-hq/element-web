/**
 * A React hook whose value is whether the local device has been "verified".
 *
 * Figuring out if we are verified is an async operation, so on the first render this always returns `false`, but
 * fires off a background job to update a state variable. It also registers an event listener to update the state
 * variable changes.
 *
 * @param client - Matrix client.
 * @returns A boolean which is `true` if the local device has been verified.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Some notes on implementation.
 *
 * It turns out "is this device verified?" isn't a question that is easy to answer as you might think.
 *
 * Roughly speaking, it normally means "do we believe this device actually belongs to the person it claims to belong
 * to", and that data is available via `getDeviceVerificationStatus().isVerified()`. However, the problem is that for
 * the local device, that "do we believe..." question is trivially true, and `isVerified()` always returns true.
 *
 * Instead, when we're talking about the local device, what we really mean is one of:
 *  * "have we completed a verification dance (either interactive verification with a device with access to the
 *    cross-signing secrets, or typing in the 4S key)?", or
 *  * "will other devices consider this one to be verified?"
 *
 * (The first is generally required but not sufficient for the second to be true.)
 *
 * The second question basically amounts to "has this device been signed by our cross-signing key". So one option here
 * is to use `getDeviceVerificationStatus().isCrossSigningVerified()`. That might work, but it's a bit annoying because
 * it needs a `/keys/query` request to complete after the actual verification process completes.
 *
 * A slightly less rigorous check is just to find out if we have validated our own public cross-signing keys. If we
 * have, it's a good indication that we've at least completed a verification dance -- and hopefully, during that dance,
 * a cross-signature of our own device was published. And it's also easy to monitor via `UserTrustStatusChanged` events.
 *
 * Sooo: TL;DR: `getUserVerificationStatus()` is a good proxy for "is the local device verified?".

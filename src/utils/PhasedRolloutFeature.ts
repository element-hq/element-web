/**
 * The PhasedRolloutFeature class is used to manage the phased rollout of a new feature.
 *
 * It uses a hash of the user's identifier and the feature name to determine if a feature is enabled for a specific user.
 * The rollout percentage determines the probability that a user will be enabled for the feature.
 * The feature will be enabled for all users if the rollout percentage is 100, and for no users if the percentage is 0.
 * If a user is enabled for a feature at x% rollout, it will also be for any greater than x percent.
 *
 * The process ensures a uniform distribution of enabled features across users.
 *
 * @property featureName - The name of the feature to be rolled out.
 * @property rolloutPercentage - The int percentage (0..100) of users for whom the feature should be enabled.

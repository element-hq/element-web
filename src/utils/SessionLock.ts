/*
 * Functionality for checking that only one instance is running at once
 *
 * The algorithm here is twofold.
 *
 * First, we "claim" a lock by periodically writing to `STORAGE_ITEM_PING`. On shutdown, we clear that item. So,
 * a new instance starting up can check if the lock is free by inspecting `STORAGE_ITEM_PING`. If it is unset,
 * or is stale, the new instance can assume the lock is free and claim it for itself. Otherwise, the new instance
 * has to wait for the ping to be stale, or the item to be cleared.
 *
 * Secondly, we need a mechanism for proactively telling existing instances to shut down. We do this by writing a
 * unique value to `STORAGE_ITEM_CLAIMANT`. Other instances of the app are supposed to monitor for writes to
 * `STORAGE_ITEM_CLAIMANT` and initiate shutdown when it happens.
 *
 * There is slight complexity in `STORAGE_ITEM_CLAIMANT` in that we need to watch out for yet another instance
 * starting up and staking a claim before we even get a chance to take the lock. When that happens we just bail out
 * and let the newer instance get the lock.
 *
 * `STORAGE_ITEM_OWNER` has no functional role in the lock mechanism; it exists solely as a diagnostic indicator
 * of which instance is writing to `STORAGE_ITEM_PING`.

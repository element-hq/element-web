/**
 * Access class to get a singleflight context. Singleflights execute a
 * function exactly once, unless instructed to forget about a result.
 *
 * Typically this is used to de-duplicate an action, such as a save button
 * being pressed, without having to track state internally for an operation
 * already being in progress. This doesn't expose a flag which can be used
 * to disable a button, however it would be capable of returning a Promise
 * from the first call.
 *
 * The result of the function call is cached indefinitely, just in case a
 * second call comes through late. There are various functions named "forget"
 * to have the cache be cleared of a result.
 *
 * Singleflights in our use case are tied to an instance of something, combined
 * with a string key to differentiate between multiple possible actions. This
 * means that a "save" key will be scoped to the instance which defined it and
 * not leak between other instances. This is done to avoid having to concatenate
 * variables to strings to essentially namespace the field, for most cases.

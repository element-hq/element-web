// WARNING: We have to be very careful about what mime-types we allow into blobs,
// as for performance reasons these are now rendered via URL.createObjectURL()
// rather than by converting into data: URIs.
//
// This means that the content is rendered using the origin of the script which
// called createObjectURL(), and so if the content contains any scripting then it
// will pose a XSS vulnerability when the browser renders it.  This is particularly
// bad if the user right-clicks the URI and pastes it into a new window or tab,
// as the blob will then execute with access to Element's full JS environment(!)
//
// See https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/1820#issuecomment-385210647
// for details.
//
// We mitigate this by only allowing mime-types into blobs which we know don't
// contain any scripting, and instantiate all others as application/octet-stream
// regardless of what mime-type the event claimed.  Even if the payload itself
// is some malicious HTML, the fact we instantiate it with a media mimetype or
// application/octet-stream means the browser doesn't try to render it as such.
//
// One interesting edge case is image/svg+xml, which empirically *is* rendered
// correctly if the blob is set to the src attribute of an img tag (for thumbnails)
// *even if the mimetype is application/octet-stream*.  However, empirically JS
// in the SVG isn't executed in this scenario, so we seem to be okay.
//
// Tested on Chrome 65 and Firefox 60
//
// The list below is taken mainly from
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Supported_media_formats
// N.B. Matrix doesn't currently specify which mimetypes are valid in given
// events, so we pick the ones which HTML5 browsers should be able to display
//
// For the record, mime-types which must NEVER enter this list below include:
//   text/html, text/xhtml, image/svg, image/svg+xml, image/pdf, and similar.

/*
 * Sliding Sync Architecture - MSC https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575
 *
 * This is a holistic summary of the changes made to Element-Web / React SDK / JS SDK to enable sliding sync.
 * This summary will hopefully signpost where developers need to look if they want to make changes to this code.
 *
 * At the lowest level, the JS SDK contains an HTTP API wrapper function in client.ts. This is used by
 * a SlidingSync class in JS SDK, which contains code to handle list operations (INSERT/DELETE/SYNC/etc)
 * and contains the main request API bodies, but has no code to control updating JS SDK structures: it just
 * exposes an EventEmitter to listen for updates. When MatrixClient.startClient is called, callers need to
 * provide a SlidingSync instance as this contains the main request API params (timeline limit, required state,
 * how many lists, etc).
 *
 * The SlidingSyncSdk INTERNAL class in JS SDK attaches listeners to SlidingSync to update JS SDK Room objects,
 * and it conveniently exposes an identical public API to SyncApi (to allow it to be a drop-in replacement).
 *
 * At the highest level, SlidingSyncManager contains mechanisms to tell UI lists which rooms to show,
 * and contains the core request API params used in Element-Web. It does this by listening for events
 * emitted by the SlidingSync class and by modifying the request API params on the SlidingSync class.
 *
 *    (entry point)                     (updates JS SDK)
 *  SlidingSyncManager                   SlidingSyncSdk
 *       |                                     |
 *       +------------------.------------------+
 *         listens          |          listens
 *                     SlidingSync
 *                     (sync loop,
 *                      list ops)

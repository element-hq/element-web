# Labs features

Some notes on the features you can enable by going to `Settings->Labs`. Not exhaustive, chat in
[#riot-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#riot-web:matrix.org) for more information.

**Be warned! Labs features are not finalised, they may be fragile, they may change, they may be
dropped. Ask in the room if you are unclear about any details here.**

## Message pinning (`feature_pinning`)

Allows you to pin messages in the room. To pin a message, use the 3 dots to the right of the message
and select "Pin".

## Custom status (`feature_custom_status`)

An experimental approach for supporting custom status messages across DMs. To set a status, click on
your avatar next to the message composer.

## Custom tags (`feature_custom_tags`)

An experimental approach for dealing with custom tags. Custom tags will appear in the bottom portion
of the community filter panel.

Setting custom tags is not supported by Riot.

## Render simple counters in room header (`feature_state_counters`)

Allows rendering of labelled counters above the message list.

Once enabled, send a custom state event to a room to set values:

1. In a room, type `/devtools` to bring up the devtools interface
2. Click "Send Custom Event"
3. Toggle from "Event" to "State Event"
4. Set the event type to: `re.jki.counter` and give it a unique key
5. Specify the content in the following format:

```
{
    "link": "",
    "severity": "normal",
    "title": "my counter",
    "value": 0
}
```

That's it. Now should see your new counter under the header.

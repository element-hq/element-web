# Beta features

Beta features are features that are not ready for production yet but the team
wants more people to try the features and give feedback on them.

Before a feature gets into its beta phase, it is often a labs feature (see
[Labs](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/blob/develop/docs/labs.md)).

**Be warned! Beta features may not be completely finalised or stable!**

## Video rooms (`feature_video_rooms`)

Enables support for creating and joining video rooms, which are persistent video
chats that users can jump in and out of.

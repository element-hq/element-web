## Security notice

Element Web 1.7.28 fixes (by upgrading to matrix-react-sdk 3.21.0) a low
severity issue (GHSA-8796-gc9j-63rv) related to file upload. When uploading a
file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the
uploaded file, but only after several user interactions to open the preview in
a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of
uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. Thanks to
[Muhammad Zaid Ghifari](https://github.com/MR-ZHEEV) for responsibly disclosing
this via Matrix's Security Disclosure Policy.

## Security notice

Element Web 1.7.22 fixes (by upgrading to matrix-react-sdk 3.15.0) a moderate
severity issue (CVE-2021-21320) where the user content sandbox can be abused to
trick users into opening unexpected documents after several user interactions.
The content can be opened with a `blob` origin from the Matrix client, so it is
possible for a malicious document to access user messages and secrets. Thanks to
@keerok for responsibly disclosing this via Matrix's Security Disclosure Policy.

============================================================================================
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/compare/v1.5.14...v1.5.15)

## Security notice

The `jitsi.html` widget wrapper introduced in Riot 1.5.14 could be used to extract user data by tricking the user into adding a custom widget or opening a link in the browser used to run Riot. Jitsi widgets created through Riot UI do not pose a risk and do not need to be recreated.

It is important to purge any copies of Riot 1.5.14 so that the vulnerable `jitsi.html` wrapper from that version is no longer accessible.

## All changes

 * Upgrade React SDK to 2.3.1 for Jitsi fixes
 * Fix popout support for jitsi widgets

   have been revealed to the room if you accepted an incoming call.
 * Also adds the Slovak translation.

# List of allowed TLS fingerprints for this server to publish along
# with the signing keys for this server. Other matrix servers that
# make HTTPS requests to this server will check that the TLS
# certificates returned by this server match one of the fingerprints.
#
# Synapse automatically adds the fingerprint of its own certificate
# to the list. So if federation traffic is handled directly by synapse
# then no modification to the list is required.
#
# If synapse is run behind a load balancer that handles the TLS then it
# will be necessary to add the fingerprints of the certificates used by
# the loadbalancers to this list if they are different to the one
# synapse is using.
#
# Homeservers are permitted to cache the list of TLS fingerprints
# returned in the key responses up to the "valid_until_ts" returned in
# key. It may be necessary to publish the fingerprints of a new
# certificate and wait until the "valid_until_ts" of the previous key
# responses have passed before deploying it.
#
# You can calculate a fingerprint from a given TLS listener via:
# openssl s_client -connect $host:$port < /dev/null 2> /dev/null |
#   openssl x509 -outform DER | openssl sha256 -binary | base64 | tr -d '='
# or by checking matrix.org/federationtester/api/report?server_name=$host

## Server ##

# The domain name of the server, with optional explicit port.
# This is used by remote servers to connect to this server,
# e.g. matrix.org, localhost:8080, etc.
# This is also the last part of your UserID.
server_name: "localhost"

# When running as a daemon, the file to store the pid in
pid_file: {{SYNAPSE_ROOT}}homeserver.pid

# CPU affinity mask. Setting this restricts the CPUs on which the
# process will be scheduled. It is represented as a bitmask, with the
# lowest order bit corresponding to the first logical CPU and the
# highest order bit corresponding to the last logical CPU. Not all CPUs
# may exist on a given system but a mask may specify more CPUs than are
# present.
#
# For example:
#    0x00000001  is processor #0,
#    0x00000003  is processors #0 and #1,
#    0xFFFFFFFF  is all processors (#0 through #31).
#
# Pinning a Python process to a single CPU is desirable, because Python
# is inherently single-threaded due to the GIL, and can suffer a
# 30-40% slowdown due to cache blow-out and thread context switching
# if the scheduler happens to schedule the underlying threads across
# different cores. See
